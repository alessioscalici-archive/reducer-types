# redules

A library to write reducer-based state in a concise, readable and efficient way.


## Features

- Allows to define a reducer, and many actions to interact with it, simply calling a function
- Extremely easy to integrate
- Create new actions by grouping many actions into one. Execute the reducer only once!
- Usable with existing reducer-based states (e.g. existing Redux code)


## TODO:

- Custom type (providing unique name, type checker, set of actions)
